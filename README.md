# Challenge-02-Work-Portfolio
A portfolio of my work that outlines my skills and knowledge to potential employers.

## Description

This website is to display information about me, my skills, the work I have completed, and how to contact me. This code was developed with no template - the HTML file follows semantic HTML structure and accessibility standards; the CSS file outlines formatting requirements and outlines media queries to ensure that when the page is re-sized or accessed from a mobile phone and tablet that the site remains visually appealing and has the same functionality.
